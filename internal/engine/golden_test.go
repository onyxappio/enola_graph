package engine_test

// End-to-end golden + determinism tests for the full extraction pipeline.
//
// Unlike the per-extractor unit tests (which feed inline snippets to a single
// extractor), these run the real engine wired exactly as production wires it
// (via bootstrap.NewEngine: all 9 extractors, 9 explainers, the llm_context
// renderer) over small fixture repos under testdata/repos, then assert the
// emitted fact graph byte-for-byte against a committed golden file.
//
// This is the regression net for Enola's core promise — "deterministic,
// structurally faithful extraction." A golden mismatch means the fact graph
// for a known repo changed; a reviewer diffs the regenerated JSONL to decide
// whether the change is intended. Regenerate with:
//
//	go test ./internal/engine -run TestGolden -update
//
// The golden captures only the fact graph (Store.WriteJSONL, which sorts facts
// and their relations deterministically). Snapshot metadata (timestamps,
// durations, file hashes, absolute repo path) is intentionally excluded so the
// golden is stable across machines and runs.

	// repo emitted zero routes and was classified `isolated` while every SDK call sat
	// unresolved. Covers both argument forms (@Controller({path}) and

	// site is emitted twice and no client route is reclassified; (b) a sub-router
