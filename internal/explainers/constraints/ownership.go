// What a component owns is declared, never inferred, and the two declaring
// places are read through exactly one statement of precedence —
// intent.OwnershipPrecedence. Nothing in this file decides an order; it reads
// one, so a later change cannot invert the precedence here while the validator
// still states the other one.
//
// Ownership widens what a rule may WALK, never what the component contains.
// Membership stays what the selectors chose: cap counts the same set, require
// reads the same facts, and `constraints lint` prints the same numbers. What
// changes is that an edge sourced by one of a member's METHODS, or landing on
// one, now resolves onto the component — and the verdict says so in the owned
// basis rather than claiming an exactness it does not have.
//
// Methods, and nothing else. The whole of what this file reads is the graph's
// has_method edges, so a constant, a nested class or an attr_accessor variable
// written in a member's body is not owned and an edge landing on one lands
// outside the component.

// methodIndex answers which facts are a member's methods. It reads the graph's
// synthesized has_method edges rather than re-deriving ownership from the shape
// of a name, so there is one definition of what makes a fact a member's and
// every surface that asks gets the same answer. Ruby names an instance method
// `Owner#method` and a class's calls ride those facts, which is the whole
// reason the question exists. Facts a member merely lexically encloses carry no
// has_method edge and are therefore not here.
