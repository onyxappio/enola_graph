// The declaration screen refuses the pairings this vocabulary can never state a
// basis for. What it cannot see is the snapshot: a component may declare an
// ownership honestly and still reach nothing, because the estate measures no
// methods for its members, or because its members carry no edge of the kind
// the rule walks. A rule then resolves that role against nothing and reads the
// nothing as a verdict — an owners: that owns no edge makes every edge unowned,
// an only: that absorbs no landing makes every landing disallowed.
//
// The question is asked per role and on ONE side. The previous machinery ORed
// three arms belonging to different directions, so an edge pointing the wrong
// way declared a component sighted — deleting an unrelated INBOUND edge flipped
// an owners: rule from a false breach to a correct refusal, which is a verdict
// depending on a fact no rule mentioned. A source-side role asks only whether
// the component's edge sources carry such an edge; a target-side role asks only
// whether such an edge resolves onto it.
//
// One reading is deliberately not asked, and only one: the subject of an
// existential form resolved against the end an edge LANDS on. There an empty
// resolution IS the breach the form exists to report, so a reach test asking
// the same question silences exactly the total violation — which is how a rule
// reporting zero breaches against a total violation shipped once. The
// source-side subject of the same forms gets no such pass: see censusAnswers.

// edgeReachConfidence is the gate-failing 1.0 rather than the 0.4 the skip
// advisories sit at, for the reason unmeasuredPropConfidence is: a skip
// advisory reports a verdict not reached for a cause the snapshot cannot
// resolve, while a role that resolves nothing is not ambiguous. The rule would
// emit either nothing or a full set of false breaches, and both read as decided.
