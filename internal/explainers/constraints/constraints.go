// Package constraints verdicts declared constraint rules against the measured
// graph — the enforcement half of the components/rules vocabulary pages
// declare. A component resolves to the measured facts its match patterns
// select (the same bounded path dialect declared layers use); a rule states
// one of the enforceable forms in intent.RuleForms — twenty-one of them, and
// that table is the count's only source: forbid (one component must
// not reach another via a named edge kind), forbid_reach (one component must
// not reach another through ANY measured path of rule-via edges — the
// transitive form, a bounded breadth-first walk whose shortest witness path
// each violation renders, degrading to one 0.4 advisory when a membership is
// too large to walk), allow-only (a component's edges
// may land only in the named components), protect (only the named owner
// components may reach this one — walked from the whole graph, since the
// unknown is the source), private (the component's non-exported members may
// be reached only from inside it or from the except components — the
// visibility form, walked from the whole graph over every rule-via edge kind
// against the extractor-measured exported prop), forbid-fact (a component's
// membership must be empty), cap (a component's membership must not exceed a
// declared count), require (members matching an optional when-clause must
// carry a named prop value — verdicting what a fact carries rather than what
// edges it makes), and require-defines (every class-kind member symbol must
// have a measured method symbol of the declared name — the protocol form; a
// class that inherits, includes or extends anything is out of scope, fail
// closed, because the definition could ride composition the check cannot see
// through), and require-name (every member fact's name must match a bounded
// convention pattern — prefix*, *suffix, or exact, never a general glob or
// regex), and require-edge (every member must have at least one measured edge
// of the declared via kind, inbound or outbound, optionally scoped to a
// counterpart component — the existential form: where every other edge form
// forbids an edge, this one demands one exists, so an orphaned event or an
// unconsumed route is a breach instead of invisible; a member whose edge
// visibility the snapshot cannot demonstrate for that file kind is skipped
// with a named count, fail closed), and protocol (members of one component
// conform to an ordered list of step components: a member making a via edge
// into step K's members must also make via edges into every step 1..K-1's
// members — the ordered form. It verdicts STRUCTURAL protocol conformance,
// which a static graph can decide — a caller that structurally skips a
// mandatory step — and never runtime ordering, which it cannot: that step 1
// executes before step 2 is a claim only a runtime-observed sequence could
// back, so the compiled rule carries verification: structural and the
// observed level stays future runtime-provider work. A member touching no
// step is a bystander the rule does not bind; a member whose file class
// cannot demonstrate the via kind is skipped with a named count, fail
// closed). A further form, guide, is steering rather than law: advice for
// whoever is about to edit inside the component, delivered through the
// pre-edit contract (ContractFor) with each exemplar checked present or
// absent against the snapshot. In notify mode (its default) a guidance rule
// emits no finding ever; in advisory mode it emits ONE 0.9 finding per
// guided component — never one per member, because guidance is not a
// violation census — so it rides check output visibly and can fail nothing.
//
// Eight further forms state laws only a graph can settle: forbid_cycles/among
// (the named parts may not depend on each other in a circle), independent (no
// module in the component reaches a class whose resolved ancestry includes
// it), forbid_name (the negative of require_name), storage_stays_home (every
// storage fact a member reaches is itself a member), cap_runtime (a
// runtime-observed metric per member frame stays under a budget),
// require_consumer (every member route has a client in the snapshot),
// unique_across (no two members in different repositories share the named
// property), and require_governed (every member file carries an anchor from a
// compiled page).
//
// Everything here is exact and fail-closed: membership is path equality or a
// declared subtree, target resolution is exact fact-name match — an edge whose
// target string does not name a member is no violation, never a guess — and a
// violation is a decided-rule breach at confidence 1.0, because the rule was
// stated and the edge is measured. A rule declared advisory reports its
// breaches at a confidence below the check gate's floor, so the finding
// surfaces without failing anything. The one advisory this package emits on
// its own is the zero-member component note, so a selector that matches
// nothing is visible instead of silently satisfying every rule that names it.

// contain. `superclass:` is exactly what the extractor wrote down — the parent
// as the source spelled it, one level — so a rule over it judges the base
// classes and says nothing about what is written underneath them. Measured on
// the monolith, `superclass: ViewComponent::Base` names 269 of the 357 classes
// whose ancestry reaches it. Neither existing advisory can see that: the
// component is not empty and the property is measured, so the selector looks
// like it worked.
//
// The witnesses are lexical, like the property they read: a class counts here
// when it wrote a member's fact name as its parent and carries an implements
// edge to that same text. The count is therefore NEITHER a floor NOR a ceiling,
// and it errs in both directions. It misses: a subclass that spelled its parent
// relatively — the unqualified `Base` inside a module — writes text no member's
// fact name equals. And it over-attributes: the index is keyed on the parent AS
// WRITTEN and looked up by a member's RESOLVED fact name, so a module-scoped
// `Base` and a top-level `Base` are one key, and a class inheriting the first
// is named as a subclass of the second. Both are the same fact about the
// property — `superclass` is source text — and no reading of it can be
// transitive or namespace-aware without a resolution pass the extractor did not
// make. The advisory says so rather than claiming a bound it does not have.
