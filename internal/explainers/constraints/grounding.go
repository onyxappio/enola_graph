// Component membership resolves an edge's target by exact fact name, and a
// file-granular import target names no fact: module facts are named by directory
// (`lib`), symbol facts by `dir.symbol` (`lib.app`), while the TS extractor
// measures `require('./application')` as an imports edge onto the PATH
// `lib/application`. So the dominant dependency mechanism of a classic Node
// codebase was measured and unenforceable, and the silence read as compliance
// (finding 0010).
//
// The grounding below is the contained fix: a target that names no fact, but
// does name a file this repository measured, joins the component that file
// belongs to. It is strictly subordinate — every caller asks exact-name
// membership first and only falls back here — so no rule whose target already
// grounds by name can change verdict. It is scoped to one repository, because an
// extension-less path is only meaningful relative to the tree it was written in.
// And it applies to path-targeting edges only, which pathTargetEdge decides: a
// calls or implements target is a symbol name, never a path, so resolving one as
// a file could only ever be a guess.

// resolutionLevelProp and markupDeclaredLevel mirror the extractor vocabulary a
// markup pass stamps on the facts it emits. Spelled here rather than imported so
// this explainer keeps depending only on facts, exactly as the binders do.

// written in an ERB view and the Ruby pass resolves it to the controller FILE by
// naming convention, so the edge lands on a path for the same reason an import

// grounding indexes what each repository measured: every file, and every fact

// widening a predicate: the files each component actually measured a member in.
// A path component's match globs ARE its claim about files, so joining a
// resolved path to them says what the declaration said. A predicate component's
// claim is about one measured fact, and its match globs are a scope the
// predicate narrows — so a resolved path inside the globs is not inside the
// component unless the component measured a member there. Without that, a
// component declaring `match: app/components/**` AND
// `where: {superclass: ViewComponent::Base}` answered for its whole glob as an
// edge target: 41 imports edges in the monolith resolve to a file under those
// globs that hosts no member at all, and each one drew a 1.0 verdict on code
