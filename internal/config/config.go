	// Repos is the ordered list of repositories that form a multi-repo cluster.
	// When set it supersedes Repo, and the whole cluster is indexed in one run —
	// the first repository fresh, the rest appended.
	//
	// It exists because cross-repo linking was previously reachable only from an
	// MCP session: `append` is a generate_snapshot tool parameter, and both CLIs
	// hardcoded false, so a CI job or a developer not driving an agent could only
	// ever see the single-repo subset (no service nodes, no cross-repo edges, no
	// coverage_report, no unused-routes). Naming the cluster in the config also
	// makes its composition a reviewable file rather than a property of the order
	// somebody happened to issue tool calls in.
	//
	// Entries are resolved relative to the DIRECTORY OF THIS FILE, not the working
	// directory, so a checked-in cluster config means the same thing wherever it is

	// It exists because the two cases are indistinguishable afterwards and mean
	// opposite things. An explicit list REPLACES the defaults (YAML unmarshalling of
	// a sequence overwrites the slice), so a config written before an extractor
