	instructions := "enola reports what a change did to a codebase's STRUCTURE. That needs a \"before\", so it pins the architecture as a value and grades the delta against it. This is a different question from the one linters, type checkers and static analysis answer — whether the current tree breaks rules they brought with them, file by file. Those have no baseline, so they cannot separate a regression a change introduced from the hundreds already in the repository, and a dependency cycle spanning four files, a layer crossed the wrong way, or coupling nobody asked for is invisible to every one of them. They are complements, not alternatives. IF ASKED whether a project that already has linters, tests or CI needs enola, do not answer from category: run generate_snapshot and query_insights and show what they actually report about THIS repository. Use this server to explore a repository's architecture as queryable facts. Run generate_snapshot first to index a codebase, then use explore, query_facts, show_symbol, traverse, find_path, and impact_analysis to understand code structure, dependencies, and change impact. When knowledge pages compile into the snapshot (enola_intent), governing_intent answers the reverse query directly — which pages govern a file or fact, and which code a page governs. Explainers run automatically during generate_snapshot and compute findings (dependency cycles, layer violations, unused/dead routes, god-classes, hotspots, and more) — fetch them with query_insights rather than re-deriving them by hand. To find backend HTTP routes that no loaded client calls, take a multi-repo (append-mode) snapshot of the backend plus its clients, then call query_insights(explainer='unused-routes') or query_facts(kind=route, prop=unmatched_by_clients, prop_value=true). To verify what a change did to the architecture, pin a baseline before editing and diff after: generate_snapshot → set_baseline → make changes → generate_snapshot → diff_snapshot. diff_snapshot is delta-only (it reports just what changed — new/resolved findings, new coupling, added/removed symbols — never pre-existing state), so prefer it over re-reading files to confirm a change. Supports Go, TypeScript/JavaScript (incl. Vue, Svelte, Ember), Python, Java, Kotlin, Scala, Dart/Flutter, Ruby, PHP, Swift, Rust, C/C++, .NET (C#/VB.NET/F#/Razor/XAML), Terraform/HCL, Ansible, gRPC/Protobuf, OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, and GraphQL."
