// Fact identity for EXTERNAL consumers.
//
// A relation names its target by NAME, and names repeat: a snapshot of any size
// carries several facts under one name, and a consumer that re-materializes the
// graph in its own database must guess which one an edge meant. Cognee guesses
// with an exact match, an unqualified-suffix fallback and a same-repo
// preference, and DROPS the edge when the guess is ambiguous. The ids below
// replace the guess.
//
// For ordinary facts the identity is (repo, kind, name, file). Generic
// repository-plugin kinds reserve the "plugin:" namespace and use
// (repo, kind, name): their source file is the replaceable owner, while Name is
// the stable domain identity. It is computed at serialization and never stored
// on a Fact, which also keeps it off a struct that exists 39M times on the
// largest graphs.

// idBytes is the identity's width in bytes. 128 bits is far past what the
// birthday bound needs: at 39M facts — the largest graph measured — the odds of
// any collision are about 1 in 10^14, and a collision is the one failure this
// exists to prevent (two distinct facts merging into one node is exactly the
// bug being fixed, arriving by a different door).
const idBytes = 16

// FactID returns the stable identity of a fact as 32 lowercase hex characters.
// For kinds in the reserved "plugin:" namespace, file is intentionally omitted
// so moving an entity between owner files does not change its graph identity.
//
// The identity is (repo, kind, name, file). Name alone is not enough — two
// functions sharing a name in different files are distinct facts, and merging
// them is the loss this fixes — and file alone is not enough either, since one
// file declares many facts.
//
// It is a pure function of those four strings: the same tree yields the same id
// on any machine and in any run, matching the byte-stability guarantee the rest
// of the artifact makes. It does NOT include line or column, so an id survives
// code moving down a file; that is the point of an identity, and it is why an id
// stays comparable across two snapshots of a repository that edited something
// above it.
//
// IDENTITY, NOT UNIQUENESS. Facts can share all four fields — one file importing
// the same target at two statements, two overloads declared at different lines —
// and such facts share an id. Measured on a 20,808-fact snapshot: 482 ids cover
// 706 facts. Those repeats are the same thing recorded twice, so a consumer
// keying nodes on the id merges them, which is the correct outcome. Adding line
// would not fix it (244 repeats survive it) and would cost the stability above.

// so the next call can reuse it.
//
// The serialization path computes one id per fact plus one per resolved relation
// — several million on a large graph — and allocation COUNT is what the memory
// ratchet grades. Written the obvious way (sha256.New, Sum(nil), EncodeToString)
// each id costs three allocations; this costs one, the returned string, which is
// the only part that has to outlive the call.
