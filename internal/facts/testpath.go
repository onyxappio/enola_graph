// testSegments are path segments that mark a test or test-support tree: test
// sources, and the mock/fixture/helper packages that exist only to serve them.
// Membership is an exact, case-sensitive segment match.
//
// These carry the weight of the predicate. Every language enola supports puts its
// tests in a tool-enforced directory — an Xcode test target (Tests/, Mocks/), a
// Gradle source set (src/test/, src/androidTest/, and the KMP per-target trees),
// a pytest/rspec tree, a Jest __tests__/ — so the directory is the reliable signal
// and the filename is not. See IsTestPath for why that distinction matters.

// testFileSuffixes are the filename conventions safe enough to trust on their own,
// for the languages whose tests are genuinely colocated with production source:
// Go's `_test.go` (reserved by the compiler — a production file cannot be named
// this), pytest's `*_test.py`, RSpec's `*_spec.rb`, and the dotted Jest/Vitest
// forms, which really do appear outside a test tree (`cypress/e2e/explore/
// chart.test.js` on python/superset is one).
//
// Several sibling conventions are deliberately ABSENT. The criterion is empirical:
// a filename rule is dropped when, measured across the corpus, the files it
// uniquely claims — the ones no directory segment already covers — are ALL
// production code. Each of these was:
//
//   - Swift `Tests.swift`/`Test.swift` and Kotlin `Test.kt`/`Tests.kt`/`Spec.kt`.
//     On a large iOS app they matched 402 files, 393 already covered by a segment,
//     and all 9 of the remainder were production A/B-test features
//     (`FeatureRolloutABTest.swift`, `Tracking+ExperimentABTest.swift`, …). On
//     a large Android app: 261 matched, 260 already covered, the 1 remainder a
//     production model (`api/…/model/ABTest.kt`). Neither SPM nor Gradle will build
//     a test from a production target, so the real tests are always in the test
//     tree and these rules had no true positives to contribute.
//   - Ruby `_test.rb`. Across the whole corpus it uniquely claimed exactly one
//     file: `app/jobs/notification/finish_experiment_ab_test.rb` — the
//     production ActiveJob that the identically-shaped `**/*_test.rb` ignore glob
//     once deleted from the graph outright, and which is why that glob is now
//     directory-scoped. Minitest files live in `test/`, which the segments claim.
//   - pytest's `test_*.py` PREFIX. It uniquely claimed three files on
//     python/superset and all three were production commands that *test a database
//     connection*: `superset/cli/test_db.py`, `superset/cli/test_loaders.py`,
//     `superset/commands/database/test_connection.py`.
//
// The rule that survives is: a name that merely LOOKS like a test is production.
// Erring this way costs at worst a false negative (a stray colocated test rated as
// production, which shows up as noise); erring the other way silently removes
// production code from the analysis, which is strictly worse and much harder to
// notice. It is the same reason ModuleRoleForPath matches whole '-'/'_' tokens
// rather than substrings.
//
// Residual risk, recorded honestly: `_test.py` and `_spec.rb` have the same
// theoretical collision as `_test.rb` (a production `feature_ab_test.py`), but
// unlike `_test.rb` no such file exists on the corpus, and dropping them would
// re-introduce false-positive orphans for colocated pytest suites. If one ever
// turns up, they go the way of `_test.rb`.

	// admission rule — and neither is reachable by the `.spec.ts`/`.test.ts` entries
	// above, because those require a leading dot the hyphenated form does not have.
	// Without them a NestJS API's e2e suite reads as production HTTP-client code:

// classify through here. They previously carried three separate copies that had
// drifted apart in both directions, and a fourth consumer had no path check at all.
//
// Conservative by construction: an exact directory-segment match, or a filename
// convention that a tool enforces. A name that merely *looks* like a test —
// `ABTest.swift`, `test_job.rb`, `contest/`, `latest/` — is production code and
// stays in the graph.
