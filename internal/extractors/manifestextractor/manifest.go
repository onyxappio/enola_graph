// Package manifestextractor reads a repository's DECLARED direct dependencies
// out of its package manifests and emits one fact per package.
//
// Every other extractor here reads a manifest already — for detection, for
// resolution, for framework gating — and none of them emits anything about what
// it found. So a graph that knows which of its own modules import which has
// nothing to say about the far larger surface the repository pulls in from
// outside it, and the question "is every external dependency declared, pinned,
// and there for a stated reason" had no facts to be asked over.
//
// DIRECT dependencies only, deliberately. The transitive closure of a lockfile
// runs to tens of thousands of entries on an ordinary Node or Rust project, and
// every one of them would enter a graph whose cost is already dominated by
// node count. It is also the boundary the regulation draws: the Cyber Resilience
// Act's Annex I asks for a machine-readable bill of materials "covering at the
// very least the top-level dependencies", which is exactly this set.
//
// What this extractor does NOT do is connect a package to the code that uses
// it. Resolving an import path to a declared package is a per-ecosystem
// resolution problem, and guessing it would put edges in the graph that no
// parser proved — the one thing nothing here is allowed to do. A package is a
// leaf node: measured, named, versioned, and joined to code only by the
// declarations a human writes about it.
