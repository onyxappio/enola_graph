// extractAllRoutes finds and parses every Rails route file in the repository, each
// under the URL prefix the file is actually served at.
//
// A route file's prefix comes from whichever construct pulled it in, and there are
// three:
//
//   - `draw(:pkg)` from a parent file, usually inside a scope('/api')/namespace(:vN)
//     block. Parsed standalone, the delegated file loses that prefix and its routes
//     read as "/devices" instead of "/api/v2/devices", matching no client call.
//   - `mount SomeEngine, at: '/x'`, which serves an entire engine's config/routes.rb
//     below /x. Resolving the constant to its directory is what makes solidus's six
//     engines and discourse's plugin engines reachable at all.
//   - nothing — the application's own config/routes.rb, at the root prefix.
//
// So the parse is ordered: the application root first, because it declares the draws
// and mounts; then the files those name, seeded with the prefix they were named under;
// then anything left over at the root prefix, so a route file that is genuinely loaded
// by a mechanism not modelled here still contributes its routes rather than vanishing.
