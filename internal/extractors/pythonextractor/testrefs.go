// ExtractTestRefs implements plugin.TestRefExtractor. It parses pytest files for
// the SOLE purpose of capturing their outbound references into production code,
// emitting one facts.KindTestRef fact per file carrying only RelCalls/
// RelInstantiates edges — no symbols, modules or routes.
//
// Emitting nothing but references is what makes this safe to re-enable over files
// the ignore globs deliberately exclude. The FastAPI router-topology pass runs in
// Extract and is never reached from here, so a pytest fixture that assembles a
// throwaway app — app.include_router(get_x_router(), prefix="/x") — cannot put its
// test-only prefix back into the production route graph. That regression is what
// motivated ignoring Python tests in the first place; this pass must not undo it.
//
// prodFiles is the snapshot's production file list. Python spells an
// absolute-import call target as a dotted path ("pkg.mod.func"), and only the set
// of real modules says whether that names internal code or a third-party package,
// so without it resolveCallTargets would drop every production target as external
// and the emitted facts would carry no usable edges.

// refsFromPyTest parses one test file and returns a single reference-only fact

// It reuses the production walker rather than a bespoke one, so a reference from a
// test is spelled exactly as the same reference from production code would be and
// the dead-code detector needs no special case. The walker's own facts are then
// DISCARDED — only their outbound relations survive — which is what keeps this pass
// within the KindTestRef contract.
//
// Two arguments are deliberately degraded:
//
//   - idx is nil. Building the global symbol index means parsing every production
//     file (Extract's Pass 1, the expensive half of Python extraction), and doing it
//     again for a reference-only pass would roughly double snapshot cost. The walker
//     nil-checks every idx lookup. The cost is receiver-typed method calls
//     (obj.method()) going unresolved — conservative, since an unresolved target is
//     dropped and its symbol simply stays the dead-code candidate it is today.
//     Import-based references, the dominant pytest idiom, are unaffected.
//   - The framework flags are false. A test file's decorators are not production
//     routes, and the walker cannot emit route facts it was never told to look for.
//     Belt-and-braces: the facts are discarded regardless.
