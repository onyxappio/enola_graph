// Play's routes file is a DSL of its own — not Scala, and not reachable through the
// tree-sitter walker at all. It is read directly from disk for the same reason the
// OpenAPI and Symfony extractors read theirs: the ignore globs exist to suppress
// config and data noise, not to hide the file that declares a service's entire HTTP
// surface. `conf/routes` has no extension, so no glob would admit it anyway.
//
// The format is three whitespace-separated columns:
//
//	GET     /users/:id          controllers.Users.show(id: Long)
//	POST    /teams              controllers.Teams.create
//	->      /appeal             appeal.Routes
//
// The third form is an INCLUDE, and it is what makes the file a tree rather than a
// list: the included router's own routes all hang below that prefix. Reading only
// the top-level file would report `/appeal/...` endpoints at their bare paths, which
// is the same mis-mounting the Go and Rust extractors compose away for subrouters.
