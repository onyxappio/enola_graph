// Package detectnames supplies the file names an extractor's detection answers
// from, for the one caller that has no engine walk to borrow.
//
// Detection used to be a bounded re-walk inside every extractor, and every bound
// was a cliff: dotnet/runtime carries 3,270 C/C++ sources with none inside the
// three levels the C++ detector scanned, so the language was absent from the graph
// entirely. plugin.FileListDetector removes the re-walk by answering from the names
// the engine already collected. Detect remains on the plugin.Extractor interface,
// though, and out-of-engine callers still reach for it.
//
// So each migrated extractor keeps exactly ONE decision — its DetectFiles predicate
// over names — and its Detect becomes Walk plus that predicate. The two answers
// cannot drift apart, because there is only one of them.
