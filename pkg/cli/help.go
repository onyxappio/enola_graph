		Body: fmt.Sprintf(`  Tests tell you whether behaviour still works. This tells you whether a change
  altered the STRUCTURE of the system in a way nobody asked for — a layer crossed the
  wrong way, coupling between modules that had no business knowing about each other.

  It needs a "before" to compare against, so the order matters:

    1.  %s baseline pin /path/to/repo     # freeze how it looks NOW, before editing
    2.  …make your changes…
    3.  %s check /path/to/repo            # grade what they did

  Step 1 snapshots the repository and freezes it — no separate --generate needed.
  Omit the path to act on the current directory.

  The baseline lives in that repository's own output dir (.enola/baseline), so each
  repo keeps its own and you can hold baselines for several at once. "baseline show"
  reports what the current one describes; "baseline clear" removes it.

  Step 3 is read-only: it writes nothing and leaves the baseline in place, so it can
  be run as often as you like and re-run after a fix. It exits 0 when clean, 1 on a
  structural regression, 2 when it could not run, and 3 when it declined to grade
  because the baseline is not comparable — 3 is never a statement about your change.

  Step 3 fails nothing on its own. It reports every finding the change introduced and
  exits 0; "--fail-on=<explainer,…>" names the ones that should break the build, and
  "--max-spillover=N" bounds how far outside "--target" the change may reach. A run
  with neither says so in its output rather than printing a bare PASS.

  A path that names a DIRECTORY is a repository; one that names a FILE is a config.
