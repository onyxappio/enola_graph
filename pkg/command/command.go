// hook heartbeat, the file lock — and gathering them behind one surface keeps the gate's
// exit-code contract and the hook's silence rules in a single place rather than restated
// at every call site.
//
// Deliberately not folded into pkg/cli: that package is pure text (help and the tool
// catalogue) and anything wanting only `--help` would otherwise pull in the whole engine.
// This package imports pkg/cli, not the other way round.
